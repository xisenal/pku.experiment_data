# pku.Reference data for comprehensive physics experiments
## introduce:
The Comprehensive Physics Experiment Course is an innovative and practical experimental course offered by the School of Physics at Peking University, which tests the hands-on ability of students. I was fortunate enough to have taken this course this semester. Below, I will organize and store the experimental data and the Python code used in it. It is worth emphasizing that the data is for reference only, do not use it directly!

综合物理实验课是北京大学物理学院开设的一门创新型较强、比较考验同学们动手能力的的实验类课程。我有幸在这学期选修了这门课程，下面，我将这学期实验的数据以及其中使用的python代码整理并存放在这里。值得强调的是，数据仅供参考，不要直接拿来用哦！
